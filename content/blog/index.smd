This page defines the blog section and lists all posts in it.

The blog section also has an [RSS feed]($link.alternative('rss')).

In Zine, RSS feeds are considered "alternative" versions of an existing page. In
concrete defines the blog section and that lists all pages in it, is rendered in
two versions: HTML for human readers, and XML for RSS readers.

This is the SuperMD frontmatter code that defines the RSS feed:

```ziggy
.alternatives = [{
    .name = "rss",
    .layout = "rss.xml",
    .output = "index.xml",
}],
```
